# Lemon iOS

This is the source code of 杭電助手 iOS, watchOS & macOS app on App Store.

Due to changes inside the HDUHelp Team, this app is no longer maintained. As the original maintainer of this app, with inputs from the other maintainer @legends-killer, I decided to fully open source this app in its current state, hoping to find other interested community members to continue maintaining this app.

At the time of source release, the latest iOS version on App Store is 2.4.2, macOS version at 2.4. TestFlight has the latest version at 2.5(80), which is aligned with the latest commit before this README is added. Note that due to potential regulation violations, we took precautions to remove this app from App Store regions China, Hong Kong, and Macau.

This project was started when iOS 12 was the latest iOS, and spanned across iOS 13 and 14, with different parts of it built in different technologies. We have Storyboard, UIKit and SwiftUI (1.0 / 2.0) lying across the project.

Different from other projects I've open sourced, this project is kept in a ready-to-build-and-run state, and the repo isn't archived. If you feel that you can improve any part of this, please do create an issue and I personally can provide support. Pull requests are encouraged whether it's feature addition or bug fix, and we will merge and release when it's good enough. Ultimately, I want this app to be maintained by actual university students.
